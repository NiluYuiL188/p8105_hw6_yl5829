### Problem 2

```{r}
#load the data
homicides <- read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

```{r}
homicides <- homicides %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved_binary = if_else(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
  ) %>%
  filter(
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"),
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    !is.na(victim_age)
  )
head(homicides)
```

```{r}
#only baltimore data
baltimore <- homicides %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD")

#ffit logistic regression model
baltimore_glm <- glm(
  solved_binary ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
  family = binomial(),
  data = baltimore
)

#obtain odds ratio for male victims
baltimore_or <- broom::tidy(baltimore_glm) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  mutate(
    or = exp(estimate),
    ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  )
baltimore_or 
```

```{r}
#logistic regression for all cities
cities <- homicides %>%
  group_by(city_state) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(
    model = map(data, ~ glm(
      solved_binary ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race,
      family = binomial(),
      data = .
    )),
    tidy_model = purrr::map(model, broom::tidy)
  ) %>%
  unnest(tidy_model) %>%
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") %>%
  mutate(
    or = exp(estimate),
    ci_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    ci_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>%
  select(city_state, or, ci_lower, ci_upper)

cities %>%
  slice(1:5) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

```{r}
#plot
cities %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = fct_reorder(city_state, or), y = or)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = ci_lower, ymax = ci_upper), width = 0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Adjusted Odds Ratios for Solving Homicides",
    x = "City, State",
    y = "Adjusted Odds Ratio"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
Most cities smaller than OR of 1, indicating that after controlling for victim age and race, the likelihood of a crime involving a male victim being resolved is lower than that of a crime involving a female victim.

### Problem 3

```
```{r}
birthweight <- birthweight %>%

    babysex = factor(babysex, labels = c("Male", "Female")),
    frace = factor(frace, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9),
                   labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Unknown")),
    mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 8),
                   labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other")),
    malform = factor(malform, labels = c("Absent", "Present")),
    smoken = ifelse(is.na(smoken), 0, smoken), # Replace NA in smoken with 0
    across(where(is.character), as.factor) # Convert character variables to factor
  ) %>%
  drop_na() # Drop rows with missing data for simplicity
